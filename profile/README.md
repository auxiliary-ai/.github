# 🧠 Auxiliary-AI

**Auxiliary-AI** is a small team of two researchers/engineers building purposeful AI agents for real-world impact.  
Our goal is to design intelligent systems that *assist, augment, and empower* — from finance and urban analytics to social good applications.

## 🚀 About Us

We’re focused on developing modular, domain-specific AI agents that can operate autonomously or integrate into existing workflows.  
Each agent we release targets a clear, practical objective — combining interpretability, adaptability, and reliability.

| Agent | Domain | Description |
|:------|:--------|:-------------|
| **Walter** | Trading | A data-driven trading agent designed for adaptive market interaction. |
| **DAURA** | Urban Equity | Detects and analyzes disadvantaged areas in urban environments to inform equitable policy decisions. |
| *(More coming soon)* |  |  |

## 🧩 Philosophy

We believe AI should act as an **auxiliary intelligence** — a complement to human reasoning rather than a replacement.  
Our work emphasizes:
- **Transparency** – interpretable models and traceable reasoning.  
- **Efficiency** – lean architectures optimized for real-time applications.  
- **Fairness** – socially responsible systems for equitable decision-making.

## 🛠️ Current Work

- Finalizing the **DAURA** framework for disadvantaged-area detection.  
- Upgrading **Walter** with new reinforcement learning modules.  
- Prototyping agent orchestration pipelines for multi-agent collaboration.
