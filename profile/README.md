# 🧠 Auxiliary-AI

**Auxiliary-AI** is a team of researchers and engineers creating practical AI agents for real-world impact.  
We design systems that **assist**, **augment**, and **empower** — in finance, urban analytics, and social applications.


## 🚀 About

We build **modular**, **domain-specific** AI agents that can work independently or integrate into existing workflows.  
Each one is crafted for a focused purpose — combining clarity, adaptability, and reliability.


## 💡 Principles

AI should serve as an **auxiliary intelligence** — enhancing human reasoning, not replacing it.  
Our approach emphasizes:

- **Transparency** — models you can understand and trust.  
- **Efficiency** — lean, real-time systems built for performance.  
- **Fairness** — responsible design for social impact.  


## 🧩 Current Work

- Launching **DAURA** — detection of disadvantaged urban areas.  
- Advancing **Walter** — adaptive trading with reinforcement learning.  
- Prototyping **multi-agent collaboration** pipelines.
